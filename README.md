## What is it?
A simple time-tracking-application which can record the times spent on different projects and calculate the earnings
based on this.

## Installation

* Install nvm
* npm run serve - Switches to correct node-version, installs dependencies and runs tests

## Motivation

* A side-project which demonstrates some of my current approaches of developing a front-end-application, so potential
partners can get an idea of how I work. There is additional documentation about the architectural decisions that were made
for this app in the `doc`-folder in the form of "Architecture Decision Records". Please feel free to explore.
* An app that is actively used by its developer, which is in my opinion beneficial for polishing the flows and
interactions of the UI.
* A way to explore new technologies

## Next steps
* Turn it into a Progressive Web App, for better offline and mobile-support
* Implement statistics
* Authentication
